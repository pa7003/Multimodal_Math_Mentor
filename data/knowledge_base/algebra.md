# Algebra Formulas and Identities

## Quadratic Equation
For `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, the roots are:
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

## Logarithm Properties
- log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)
- log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b)
- log(a^n) = n * log(a)
- Change of base: log_b(a) = log_k(a) / log_k(b)

## Series
- Arithmetic Progression Sum: S_n = n/2 * (2a + (n-1)d)
- Geometric Progression Sum: S_n = a(r^n - 1) / (r - 1)
